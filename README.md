# ha_pelican_thermostat
Custom Component for HA that integrates Pelican Thermostats into HA

Currently this code is not completely functional. It is not making the rest calls back to the Pelican API for setting modes and values for the thermostat. WIP.

Place the entirety of the `pelican_thermostat` directory in `homeassistant/custom_components/`
